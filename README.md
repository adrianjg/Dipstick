# Dipstick

Dipstick is an augmented reality application that attempts to analyze certain biometrics and display the results in an enhanced fashion.
It is part of the "big three", with Smartpatch and Flowmeter being the other two.

The big three were part of the published paper in 2016, "Development of Smart Phone Tools for Printed Diagnostics: Challenges and Solutions".

Big thanks to Dr. Richard Fletcher!
